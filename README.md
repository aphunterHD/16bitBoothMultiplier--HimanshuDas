# 16bitBoothMultiplier--HimanshuDas
In this respository I have implemented a 16-bit booth multiplier using Verilog HDL. It takes two 8 bits signed inputs (Multiplicand & Multiplier) and produces 16-bits signed product result. As usual the signed numbers are represented in 2's complement form.

Booth multiplier is an efficient design for multipliers which consists of consecutiuve trails of 1's within 0's. As compared to partial sum approach, this implementation requires lesser number of adders.
